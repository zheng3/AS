	 * This is the function that is responsible for calling the pruning algorithm.  The algorithm
	 * will hierarchically traverse through the architectural elements and discover which elements
	 * are not linked up to architecture and need to be "pruned."  All elements in the document
	 * are cloned before pruning so that the original document is not altered.  The result is a document
     * containing only the structures and types used in the architecture. Additionally, the pruner 
     * removes any version graph whose internal nodes are not referenced by any type included in the 
     * selected architecture.

	 * @param targetArchURI This is the URL of the new xADL document that will be created and store the pruned architecture
	 * @param startingID 	This is the ID of the element that the pruning algorithm should start from
	 * @param isStructural 	If this is true then the startingID is that of an archStruct, otherwise it is an
