<BODY>
The xArch package contains utility classes for DOM-based xArch APIs.

<P>This is where the utility functions for xArch APIs reside.  Users
should pay particular attention to the <code>XArchUtils</code> class,
which can create new xArch objects, parse an XML document into an xArch
object, and generate XML from an xArch object.
