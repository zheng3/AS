/**
 * This is a utility base Thread class for executing an activity once after a
 * given delay where additional requests to execute the activity during the
 * delay period reset the delay. This is useful, for example, in dealing with
 * cases where each of a burst of events would cause a computationally-intensive
 * operation that is only dependent upon the last event. So, let's say we get
 * 1000 events inside two seconds. Each of them should trigger the
 * recomputation, but we don't want to actually recompute 1000 times when once
 * at the end would be enough. This allows us to ignore all but the last
 * request, and, after a short delay, perform recomputation once.
