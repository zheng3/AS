	 * guard in place (the algorithm will resolve the parts of the guard whose conditions
	 * are met).  All elements are cloned before selection.
	 * The after fully resolving a variant type, all elements of that variant type will 
	 * be modified to be of the new resolved type.
	 * Note: Only 1 variant can be true at any 1 time.

	 * @param startingID This is the ID of element the selection process should start from
	 * @param isStructural True if the ID passed in is a archStruct, False if the ID
	 * 		corresponds to a type & version

	 * @exception NoSuchTypeException This exception is thrown when it encounters
	 *      an unknown/invalid type when evaluating.
